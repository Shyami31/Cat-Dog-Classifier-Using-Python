# Cat and Dog Classifier

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a simple Cat and Dog classifier using Python and popular deep learning libraries.

## Overview

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. The CNN is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shyami31/Cat-Dog-Classifier-Using-Python
   cd cat-dog-classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Cat_Dog_Classifier.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.**

## Notebook Structure

- **1. Data Preprocessing:** Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- **2. Building the Model:** Defining and training the CNN model.
- **3. Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model performance.
- **4. Prediction:** Using the trained model for predicting whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

## Results

Includes some sample results or accuracy metrics obtained from training and testing the model.
