# Cat and Dog Classifier

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a simple Cat and Dog classifier using Python and popular deep learning libraries.

## Overview

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. The CNN is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

## Dataset

Download and unzip the dataset from 

```bash
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K5wAmMq1bCuZ44C-cLR4X5DgU5kiNILp/view?usp=sharing
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shyami31/Cat-Dog-Classifier-Using-Python
   cd Cat-Dog-Classifier-Using-Python
   ```
2. **Adjust Path Names:**

   Before running the Jupyter Notebook, please update any file paths or directories in the code to match the structure of your machine. Pay special attention to paths related to data       loading, model saving, and any other file operations.

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Cat_Dog_Classifier.ipynb
   ```
   If this doesn't work, try opening jupyter notebook using

   ```bash
   python -m notebook
   ```
   and upload the CatDogClassifier.ipynb   

3. **Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.**

## Notebook Structure

- **1. Data Preprocessing:** Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- **2. Building the Model:** Defining and training the CNN model.
- **3. Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model performance.
- **4. Prediction:** Using the trained model for predicting whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

## Results

Includes some sample results or accuracy metrics obtained from training and testing the model.
